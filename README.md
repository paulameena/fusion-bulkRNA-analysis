raw files can be found on HPC at:
mnt/pan/SOM_CCCC_JGS25/shultesp/data/bulkRNA-seq-fusion/RNAseq_raw_files

pre-processing (done by Arda): .slurm files, logs, and outputs an be found on HPC at:
/mnt/pan/SOM_CCCC_JGS25/durmaza/bulkrnaseq_fusion/RNASeq_Analysis/RNA_SEQ

^this was updated from when Davis ran it the first time; I need to track down those configuration .slurm files as well to identify the key differences in output and follow-up analytical results

Davis run -- output files can be found in my home directory on HPC at:
/home/pvs13/bulkRNAseq-Fusion-counts
original has since be removed from Davis's home directory following his defense (from what I can see)
